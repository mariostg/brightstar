BrightStar - A Slackware package awareness tool. 

------------
Introduction
------------
Initially I wanted something to query Slackbuilds but then I suffered from some
scope creep and things have been degenerating... That is I decided that it 
would be nice if the tool could also query native Slackware packages.
Hopefully this will not turn into a black hole. :)

It is written in C, which I have been learning, and I am also learning 
about Slackware innards which somewhat add to the challenge.  
I am not trying to replace any existing tool.  All this is astronomical 
storm is for fun.  And if this can help any Slackware user, then so be it.

Description
-----------
Brightstar, named after darkstar, the default hostname of any Slackware 
installation is aimed at making you a little more aware of your system.
It allows you to query for packages whether they are native Slackware ones 
or from Slackbuild repository.  Ability to sync Slackbuild repo is implemented
as well as downloading packages.
There is no installation or removing abilities of package at this time.  It is 
in the todo jar.
